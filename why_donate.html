      <center><p class="description autoShow">Partnerships for Children is a Central Texas nonprofit who obediently follows their mission statement, <u>"To make tomorrow better than today by supporting and empowering children, youth, and families involved with Child Protective Services."</u> The organization focuses on race equity and works to address the disproportionate impact of racism on the families it serves. Its key programs provide essential items through <b>Rainbow Rooms</b>, create holiday memories for children with open CPS cases, and raise adoption awareness through the <b>Heart Gallery of Central Texas</b>. Partnerships for Children also supports youth transitioning out of the child welfare system and offers mentoring through music, while coordinating community efforts to strengthen foster and adoptive families. In summary, Partnerships for Children is fighting for a better childhood for children in need.</p></center>
