          <p class="founder-description autoShowY">My name is Maximilian Tjiong. I’m currently a Sophomore at Meridian World School, and the Founder of Brick Wheels. Some of my biggest passions consist of basketball, coding, and helping others. I decided to create Brick Wheels because I realized, when growing up, I had a very blessed childhood, and I had toys to play with. This made me realize that other children may not have the same experiences as I had. With this in mind, I created Brick Wheels, intending to help other children to have toys to play with. Additionally, I coded this website to serve as a place to access information about this organization.</p>
